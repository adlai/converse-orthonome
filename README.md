# Equisized Synonyms

TL;DR: visit the upstream README, and/or keep reading this one.

## Naming is Hard!

What's the common annoyace of the following word pairs?

- `start` and `end`
- `length` and `width`
- `up` and `down`
- `current`, `previous` and `next`

They are closely related words but unfortunately do not have the same length!

## The Naming Tool You Always Wanted But Never Knew Existed
Given a list of words, generates a table where each column consists of the synonyms of each of the words and the rows are the respective number of letters.  You are then free to chose an equi-sized pair.
